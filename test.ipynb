      "New York City was originally inhabited by Native Americans of the Lenape tribe. It was first colonized as New Amsterdam by the Dutch in 1624. The city came under English control in 1664 and was briefly named New York before being permanently renamed New York in 1674. New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with over 8 million residents. It is a global hub of finance, commerce, culture, and immigration. The city comprises 5 boroughs and is the center of the New York metropolitan area. New York City served as the capital of the United States from 1785 to 1790. Today it is home to Wall Street and anchors the world's largest metropolitan economy.\n",
